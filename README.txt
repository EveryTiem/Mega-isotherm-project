Outline:
The NIST/ARPA-E Database of Novel and Emerging Adsorbent Materials consists of 30,000 unique isotherms collected over the course of 4 years, 
spanning 6,426 adsorbent materials and 299 adsorbate gases.[1] However, many isotherms with the same adsorbent, adsorbate, and testing 
conditions contain wildly varying graphs. We attempt to address this problem by collecting and converting data from database isotherms into a 
large collated isotherm (colloquially referred to as a “mega-isotherm”) and using Langmuir (and if better optimized in the future other) 
isotherm models to create a single standardized and more generally representative graph.
